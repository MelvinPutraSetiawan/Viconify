#This Docker configuration utilizes Docker Compose to manage containers for a MariaDB server and an Adminer interface for database management. 
#Docker images, essentially pre-packaged software environments, are used to create containers that isolate and run these applications.

#MariaDB: It uses password authentication with the root password set via an environment variable. The MySQL service is exposed on port 3306.
#Adminer: An administrative interface accessible via port 8080, allowing easy database management through a web browser.

#To run this setup:
#1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
#2. Place the docker-compose.yml in our project's root directory.
#3. Execute docker-compose up in the terminal within your project directory to start the containers.
#4. Access the Adminer interface at localhost:8080 using 'mysql' as the server, 'root' as the username, and 'root' as the password.
